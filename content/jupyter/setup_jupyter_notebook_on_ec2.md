This is tutorial on running Project Jupyter Notebook on an Amazon EC2 instance. It is based on a [tutorial](http://blog.impiyush.me/2015/02/running-ipython-notebook-server-on-aws.html) by Piyush Agarwal which did not work for me immediately, but I tweaked a few things and got it working.

Note: This is not a beginner's tutorial. I don't explain some of the steps fully and don't explain some concepts. There are other tutorials out there for that.

## Create an AWS account

An EC2 instance requires an AWS account. [You can make an account here](https://aws.amazon.com/).

## Navigate to EC2

Log into AWS and go to the EC2 main page. Then you will see a 'Launch Instance' button.

## Launch a new instance

## Select Ubuntu

![Select Ubuntu]({filename}/images/run_project_jupyter_on_amazon_ec2/select_ubuntu.png)

## Select t2.micro

![Select Micro T2]({filename}/images/run_project_jupyter_on_amazon_ec2/select_micro_t2.png)

## Check out your new instance

## Create a new security group

## Create and download a new key pair

## View connect instructions

![connect_1]({filename}/images/run_project_jupyter_on_amazon_ec2/connect_1.png)


![connect_2]({filename}/images/run_project_jupyter_on_amazon_ec2/connect_2.png)


## Set permissions on key pair

`chmod 400 tutorial.pem`

## Open terminal

![terminal]({filename}/images/run_project_jupyter_on_amazon_ec2/terminal.png)


## Connect using ssh

![ssh]({filename}/images/run_project_jupyter_on_amazon_ec2/ssh.png)


`ssh -i "tutorial.pem" ubuntu@ec2-52-39-239-66.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com`

`Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?`

## Download Anaconda to instance

Visit Anaconda's [download page](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) and right click to get the url of the latest version of the Linux 64-bit version. In my case this url was:

`https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-4.2.0-Linux-x86_64.sh`

![Anaconda!]({filename}/images/run_project_jupyter_on_amazon_ec2/anaconda.png)


Now, back in the terminal, tell the EC2 instance to download that file. Note: You aren't downloading the file to your computer, you are downloading it to the EC2 instance and installing it from there.

`wget https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-4.2.0-Linux-x86_64.sh`

![Anaconda!]({filename}/images/run_project_jupyter_on_amazon_ec2/anaconda_download.png)


## Install Anaconda

`bash Anaconda3-4.2.0-Linux-x86_64.sh`

Press enter a few times

Type 'yes' to agree

'Press ENTER to confirm the location'

![Anaconda!]({filename}/images/run_project_jupyter_on_amazon_ec2/anaconda_install.png)


`Do you wish the installer to prepend the Anaconda3 install location
to PATH in your /home/ubuntu/.bashrc ? [yes|no]
[no] >>> yes`

## Set Anaconda as the preferred environment

`which python`

`[ubuntu@ip-172-31-43-70:~$ which python
/usr/bin/python`

`source .bashrc`

## Create a password for jupyter notebook

`ipython`

`from IPython.lib import passwd`

`passwd()`

`'sha1:98ff0e580111:12798c72623a6eecd54b51c006b1050f0ac1a62d'`

`exit`

## Create config profile

`jupyter notebook --generate-config`

## Create certificates for https

`mkdir certs`

`cd certs`

`sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:1024 -keyout mycert.pem -out mycert.pem`

Answer questions

## Configure jupyter

`cd ~/.jupyter/`

`vi jupyter_notebook_config.py`

![Vim]({filename}/images/run_project_jupyter_on_amazon_ec2/vi.png)


```
c = get_config()

# Kernel config
c.IPKernelApp.pylab = 'inline'  # if you want plotting support always in your notebook

# Notebook config
c.NotebookApp.certfile = u'/home/ubuntu/certs/mycert.pem' #location of your certificate file
c.NotebookApp.ip = '*'
c.NotebookApp.open_browser = False  #so that the ipython notebook does not opens up a browser by default
c.NotebookApp.password = u'sha1:98ff0e580111:12798c72623a6eecd54b51c006b1050f0ac1a62d'  #the encrypted password we generated above
# It is a good idea to put it on a known, fixed port
c.NotebookApp.port = 8888
```

Remember to replace `sha1:98ff0e580111:12798c72623a6eecd54b51c006b1050f0ac1a62d` with your password!

![Vim]({filename}/images/run_project_jupyter_on_amazon_ec2/vi_2.png)


Press `esc`

Press `shift-z`
Press `shift-z`

## Create folder for notebooks

`cd ~`

`mkdir Notebooks`

`cd Notebooks`

## Create new screen

`screen`

## Start Jupyter notebook

`jupyter notebook`

![jupyter]({filename}/images/run_project_jupyter_on_amazon_ec2/load_jupyter.png)


## Detach from screen

Command: `Ctrl-a` and then `d`

**Other useful commands:**

1. Create new window: `Ctrl-a` `c`.
2. Switch windows: `Ctrl-a` `n`
3. Reattach to Screen: `screen -r`

## Visit Jupyter notebook in browser

Your EC2 instance will have a long url, like this:

`ec2-52-39-239-66.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com`

Visit that URL in your browser:

`https://ec2-52-39-239-66.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8888/`
