Want to learn more? I recommend working through: [R for Data Science](http://amzn.to/2myxnhi), [R Cookbook](http://amzn.to/2lF6hkb), and [R Graphics Cookbook](http://amzn.to/2m0fcPL).

```R
# Create two variables of 50 observations, note that we only use 10 month names, because to be combined into a dataset all variables must have the same number of lengths OR be a multiple of the longest length.
percent.sms.85 <- runif(50)
state <- state.name
month.85 <- month.name[1:10]
```


```R
# Create a dataframe of those two variables
usa1985 <- data.frame(state, percent.sms.85, month.85)
```


```R
percent.sms.95 <- runif(50)
state <- state.name
month.95 <- month.name[1:10]
```


```R
# Create a dataframe of those two variables
usa1995 <- data.frame(state, percent.sms.95, month.95)
```


```R
# Merge the 1995 and 1985 data frames by the variable "state"
usa <- merge(usa1985, usa1995, by = "state")
```

If some observations don't have a match, we can force the merge with the all = TRUE argument


```R
# Drop the last 10 observations in usa1985
usa1985a <- usa1985[1:40,]
```


```R
# Merge 1985 and 1995 data frames
usa.a <- merge(usa1985a, usa1995, by = "state", all = TRUE)
```


```R
usa.a
```
