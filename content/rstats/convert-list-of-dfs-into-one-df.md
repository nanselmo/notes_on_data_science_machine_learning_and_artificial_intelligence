Imagine we have two dataframes of numeric data contained within a single list, and  we want to combine that data by stacking them on top of each other as a single dataframe

Want to learn more? I recommend working through: [R for Data Science](http://amzn.to/2myxnhi), [R Cookbook](http://amzn.to/2lF6hkb), and [R Graphics Cookbook](http://amzn.to/2m0fcPL).

```R
# create some simulated data
high <- data.frame(a = 1001:1005, b = 1006:1010)
low <- data.frame(a = 1:5, b = 6:10)
```


```R
# combine them into a list
df.list <- list(low, high)
```


```R
# rbind across every item of df.list and view it
df <- do.call("rbind", df.list);df
```




          a    b
    1     1    6
    2     2    7
    3     3    8
    4     4    9
    5     5   10
    6  1001 1006
    7  1002 1007
    8  1003 1008
    9  1004 1009
    10 1005 1010
