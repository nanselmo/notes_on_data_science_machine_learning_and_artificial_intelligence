Histograms and density plots show the distribution of a single variable across it's values


```R
# load the ggplot2 library
library(ggplot2)

# set the seed so we can reproduce the results
set.seed(1410)
```


```R
# plot a histogram
qplot(carat, data = diamonds, geom = "histogram")
```

    stat_bin: binwidth defaulted to range/30. Use 'binwidth = x' to adjust this.

```R
# plot a histogram with more smoothness (by increasing bin size)
qplot(carat, data = diamonds, geom = "histogram", binwidth = 1)
```

qplot(carat, data = diamonds, geom = "density")
```

```R
# plot a density plot with a smoother line
qplot(carat, data = diamonds, adjust = 4, geom = "density")
```

```R
# plot a density plot with the color of the lines determined by the diamond's color (the "color" variable)
qplot(carat, data = diamonds, geom = "density", colour = color)
```

```R
# plot a histogram plot with the color of the lines determined by the diamond's color (the "color" variable)
qplot(carat, data = diamonds, geom = "histogram", fill = color)
```

    stat_bin: binwidth defaulted to range/30. Use 'binwidth = x' to adjust this.
