```R
# Create some dirty data that because of the mispelling is imported as a character string
dirty <- data.frame(x <- c("1.23", "4..56", "7.89"))
```


```R
# Convert the elements to numeric
factor_to_numeric <- function(f)
{
  as.numeric(levels(f))[as.integer(f)]  
}

# The data is converted, but the 4..56 is treated as an NA
factor_to_numeric(dirty$x)
```

    Warning message:
    In factor_to_numeric(dirty$x): NAs introduced by coercion




    [1] 1.23   NA 7.89
