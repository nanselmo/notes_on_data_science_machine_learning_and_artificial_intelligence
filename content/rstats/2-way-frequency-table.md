```R
# Create some data
A <- c("yes", "no","yes", "no","yes", "no","yes", "no")
B <- c("male", "female","female", "male","male", "male","male", "male")
```


```R
# A will be rows, B will be columns
mytable <- table(A,B)
```


```R
# print table
mytable
```




         B
    A     female male
      no       1    3
      yes      1    3




```R
# A frequencies (summed over B)
margin.table(mytable, 1)
```




    A
     no yes
      4   4




```R
# B frequencies (summed over A)
margin.table(mytable, 2)
```




    B
    female   male
         2      6




```R
# cell percentages
prop.table(mytable)
```




         B
    A     female  male
      no   0.125 0.375
      yes  0.125 0.375




```R
# row percentages
prop.table(mytable, 1)
```




         B
    A     female male
      no    0.25 0.75
      yes   0.25 0.75




```R
