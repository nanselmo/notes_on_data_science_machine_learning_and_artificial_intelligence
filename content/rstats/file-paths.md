Paths can be relative to the current working directory

Want to learn more? I recommend working through: [R for Data Science](http://amzn.to/2myxnhi), [R Cookbook](http://amzn.to/2lF6hkb), and [R Graphics Cookbook](http://amzn.to/2m0fcPL).

```R
# View the working directory
getwd()
```




    [1] "/Users/chrisralbon/cra/cra_projects/peripheral_brain/notebooks/rstats"




```R
# Set the working directory to the user's home directory
setwd("~")
```

- In relative paths, . denotes the currect directory
- In relative paths, .. denotes the parent directory
- In relative paths,  ~ denotes your home directory


```R
# Path.expand converts relative paths to absolutely paths
path.expand("~")
```




    [1] "/Users/chrisralbon"




```R
# basename() returns the file name without the path
basename("~")
```




    [1] "chrisralbon"




```R
# dirname returns the path without the file name
dirname("~")
```




    [1] "/Users"
